- 👋 Hi, I’m @babypeaches
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything coding, use of basic web tools, how to build and write code (with and without others). AI is another big interst of mine. I have a very small background in graphic design/arts. & not to brag... but I used to dabble in html. I could change the appearance of my name in various chat rooms; making it sparkle, or changing the font & size (xlarge or tiny), I could make it flash like a strobe light or anything my little heart desired. Impressed yet? JK
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics of the language of computers...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding, security, special projects... I am here to learn and become fluent...
